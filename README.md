# FCS-Non-Redundancy-Score
Plots the NRS (non-redundancy score) of selected markers from one or more FCS files

### Description

Inspired by the Nowicka et al [workflow](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-748), I created a simple script that will perform only the NRS section.
<br>
This was mostly just to practice / learn R and dealing with FCS files and analysis tools that may be useful.

### Usage
Copy / paste and run the script in [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and perhaps an IDE such as [R-Studio](https://rstudio.com/)
